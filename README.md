# Capstone-1-vending-machine
First capstone at Tech Elevator. Simulates vending machine software in a command line program.

## Overview

This is the first capstone that I made at Tech Elevator. My partner shall remain nameless as I have yet to ask permission to give his name.
It was the capstone to the first module, which was focused on the C# language and the .Net framework.
This module featured programming fundamentals, control structures, principles of object oriented programming, and file I/O.

## How it works
The entire program works within the command line. At this point in the program, we had yet to learn anything else.
The first menu allows the user to begin purchasing, see the inventory, and check out.
The purchase menu allows the user to purchase snacks and add money to the machine.

All persistent information is held in plain text files. These include the standard inventory and a history of all transactions.

## Known issues and future plans
As of 3 August 2019, this project is still in exactly the form that was turned in for a grade.
It has some flaws including poor encapsulation of the vending machine as compared to the CLI menus.
It also has a few glitches that we did not catch in the initial testing phase.

I may someday go back to fix some of these issues. If I decide to do so, the original project will be preserved in a separate legacy branch.
